This Basic GUI Calculator is designed with the help of Tkinter.
I have created a global variable **scvalue** which will store the result of the calculation.
The equal function is used to evaluate the final expression.
The clear(C) function is used to clear the contents of the text entry box.
The geometry method is used to set the size of the GUI window.
The code has few basic objects like Button which has text, background color etc.
In a frame, I have used 5 Buttons and there are 4 Frames.
This is Basic calculator so I have used only "+" "-" "X" "/".
I have used **eval** for all the basic direct calculations.
I am still trying to add some more accessible functions.
